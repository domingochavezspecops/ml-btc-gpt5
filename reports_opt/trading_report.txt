=== Signal Interpretation Guide ===
- A LONG signal triggers when model P(LONG) >= threshold and persists for the required bars; similarly for SHORT with its threshold.
- Persistence filter reduces noise: only act when the same signal appears in consecutive bars (e.g., 2 bars).
- Manual hints:
  * LONG setups tend to have RSI normalizing from oversold, price rising above EMA55 (close_to_ema>0), band_pos moving up from lower band, and positive short-term momentum (ret_3>0).
  * SHORT setups often show RSI rolling over from overbought, price below EMA55 (close_to_ema<0), band_pos near upper band rolling down, and negative momentum (ret_3<0).
- Position sizing: scale position with confidence and recent volatility. Higher model probability and lower vol_12 -> larger size; high vol -> reduce size.
- Costs modeled at 0.12% round-trip; ensure your live fees/slippage are equal or lower.
